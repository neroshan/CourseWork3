                        Equal opportunity at work place means that everyone should have the equal chance to apply and get selected for jobs. Everyone should be treated fairly without any differentiations. There should not be any discrimination in terms of sex, religions, disability, racial origin and martial status. Most organization has a policy to prevent discrimination at work place.

                        Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief                         that one's own race is superior. 
                        Modern variants are often based in social perceptions of biological differences    between peoples.
