                        Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief                         that one's own race is superior. 
                        Modern variants are often based in social perceptions of biological differences    between peoples.

                        Although women have had a number of decisive roles in the development of computing and the IT industry, such as Ada
                        Lovelace or Grace Hopper, the modern tech industry is perceived as a male-oriented sector; leading to gender
                        inequalities.

                        Poverty has a good number of factors that can affect the capability of a child to learn effectively in school which
                        can later lead to poor education.
